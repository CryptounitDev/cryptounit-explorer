# Managing Connections

If you want to switch to external connection other than the local default instance provided by the tool, the run `eosio-explorer init` and select the the mode 2 to enter the new connection endpoint. This will remove all the docker containers running related to the tool.

:warning: Disclaimer :warning:
Changing the connection **will clear your locally stored private keys** so please back them up in advance if you need to.
